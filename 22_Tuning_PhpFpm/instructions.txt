Workshop 24 : Tuning PHP-FPM for production

1. Configuration file
  /opt/bitnami/php/etc/php-fpm.d/www.conf

  ```
  pm = dynamic
  pm.max_children = 200
  pm.start_servers = 100
  pm.min_spare_servers = 50
  pm.max_spare_servers = 150
  ```

2. Tuning PHP-FPM

  2.1 Adjust pm.max_children

    max_children
        The number of child processes to be created when pm is set to static
      and the maximum number of child processes to be created when pm is set
      to dynamic. This option is mandatory.

    Calculate pm.max_children

      ```
        pm.max_children = RAM / Memory per child process size
      ```

    Show php-fpm Memory use

      ```
        ps -ylC php-fpm --sort:rss
      ```

    Show average memory use per process

      ```
        ps ax --no-headers -o "rss,cmd" -C php-fpm | awk '{ sum+=$1 } END { printf ("%d%s\n", sum/NR/1024,"M") }'
      ```

    Example:

      - RAM 16GB
      - Memory per process = 64MB

        MAX_CHILDREN  = (16 * 1024) / 64MB
                      = 256

      Or

        MAX_CHILDREN  = ((16 - 2) * 1024) / 64MB
                      = 224

      p.s 2GB for other process

    2.2 Adjuest pm.start_servers

      start_servers
          The number of child processes created on startup.
        Used only when pm is set to dynamic.
        Default Value: min_spare_servers + (max_spare_servers - min_spare_servers) / 2

      Example:

        - MIN_SPARE = 100
        - MAX_SPARE = 150

        START_SERVER  = 100 + (150 - 100) / 2
                      = 125

    2.3 Adjust pm.min_spare_servers

      min_spare_servers
          The desired minimum number of idle server processes.
        Used only when pm is set to dynamic. Also mandatory in this case.

    2.4 Adjust pm.max_spare_servers

      max_spare_servers
          The desired maximum number of idle server processes.
        Used only when pm is set to dynamic. Also mandatory in this case.
